MatterAndInteractionsIProject
=============================

Programming Project for CMU 33-131: Matter and Interactions I
This project attemps to simulate gas particles and measure the "speed of sound" by propigating a pressure wave through the gas particle

The SpeedTest.c and SpeedTest.py were used for testing the program's speed in C versus Python. From these it was ound that for 1000 particles and 200 iteration, the program written in C ran in about 12 seconds whereas same program written in Python ran in about 200 seconds. Clearly C is much more efficient.
